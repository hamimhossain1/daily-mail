            <p class="mt-5">1. What is the difference between Var and let and const in JavaScript?
                <br> <br>
                Answer: var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
                var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not
                re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of
                their scope.

                2. What is the difference between arrow function and regular function?
                <br> <br>
                Answer: Arguments objects are not available in arrow functions, but are available in regular functions. Regular
                functions created using function declarations or expressions are ‘constructible’ and ‘callable’. Since
                regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the ‘new’ keyword.

                3. What is the difference between map( ), forEach( ), filter( ) and find( )?
                <br> <br>
                Answer: The forEach() method calls a function once for each element in an array in order. The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function on every element in the calling array. The map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array in order. It doesn’t change the original array. The filter() method creates a new array filled with all array elements that pass the test used by the provided function. Filter() does not change the original array. The find() method returns the value of the first element in the array that meets the provided testing function. If no element meets the provided testing function, undefined is returned.

                4. Why do we use template literal in JavaScript?
                <br> <br>
                Answer:  The simplest usage of the template literal is to write a multi-line string directly. Writing multi-line strings is just the tip of the iceberg. The power of the template string literal is shown by its string interpolation ability. The tagged template is a more advanced usage of the template strings.
